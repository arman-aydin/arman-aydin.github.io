    <p>I’m currently a Master’s student in Computer Science at Stanford University, where I also completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (2020-2024). 
  I particularly enjoy tackling challenging software problems at the intersection of AI, Distributed Systems, and Networking.</p>
  
  <p>At Stanford, I’ve contributed to the Stanford Vision &amp; Learning Lab, where I worked on BEHAVIOR-1K, a human-centered embodied AI benchmark. 
  I’ve also worked in the Stanford NLP Group on Stanza, a Stanford-developed natural language analysis package that supports over 70 languages.</p>
  
  <p>Beyond academics, I’ve been teaching at Stanford since my freshman year. For three years, I tutored for the Center for Teaching and Learning in
  courses including CS106A/B, CS103, CS107, CS109, CS111, and CS161. Since 2023, I’ve been serving as a Teaching Assistant for CS107, and this will 
  be my seventh time TA’ing this class.</p>
