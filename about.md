## Work Experience

**Software Engineer**, *Stanford Vision and Learning Lab (SVL)* | (Jan 2024 - Sep 2024)

> Technologies: Python, PyTorch, 3ds Max, JavaScript, Julia, Git

- Contributed on the convex mesh data pipeline for BEHAVIOR-1K, a benchmark for evaluating Embodied AI solutions through interactive household activities with physics simulations supervised by Dr. Fei-Fei Li.

- Developed teleoperation features for OmniGibson, Stanford-developed robot/environment simulation platform built on top of NVIDIA’s IsaacSim, including operating the robot simulation with Nintendo Joy-Cons and an Adafruit Gamepad with VR headset.

- Closed support tickets for bugs reported in demos and extended support for slicing and dicing features.

- Scripting in Autodesk 3ds Max, integrating CoACD performance metrics, where achieved up to 39% speed-up in internal sanity check scripts for integrity checks of physics simulations.

**Systems Engineer Intern**, *BAYKAR Technologies* | (Jun 2023 – Sep 2023) 

> Technologies: C++, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Pandas, SQL, PostgreSQL, Go

- Contributed to internal features for data aggregation/parsing and SQL Query optimization. Spearheaded an application for optimizing distribution chains through generating and solving real-life shortest-path problems through Dijkstra’s, Floyd–Warshall, Johnson’s and A* Search Algorithms, achieving an overall %7 speed-up in August 2023.

**NLP Research Assistant**, *Stanford NLP Group* | (Jun 2022 – Sep 2022)

> Technologies: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Numpy, SQL, Bash Script, JavaScript, Pytest

- Implemented Named Entity Recognition (NER) language models for low-resource languages Kazakh (95% F1-score) and Uyghur (77% F1-score) utilizing syntactic similarities across high-resource languages like Turkish through transfer learning (supervised by Dr. John Bauer and Dr. Chris Manning).

- Enhanced the Stanford-developed Stanza natural language analysis package, with an 11% increase in parsing speed for nested NERtags, and added generalized transliteration across scripts and word span correction features.

**Software Engineer Intern**, *Infina Software Inc.* | (Jun 2021 - Aug 2021)

> Technologies: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Docker, AWS, MongoDB, Flask

- Automated and cleaned fund analysis data pipelines to achieve a 28% increase in processing speed. Implemented microservices for technical analysis indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
