  about:             |
    I'm currently a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford University, where I also completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (2020-2024). 
    I particularly enjoy tackling challenging software problems at the intersection of AI, Distributed Systems, and Networking.
    
    At Stanford, I've contributed to the Stanford Vision & Learning Lab, where I worked on BEHAVIOR-1K, a human-centered embodied AI benchmark. 
    I've also worked in the Stanford NLP Group on Stanza, a Stanford-developed natural language analysis package that supports over 70 languages.
    
    Beyond academics, I've been teaching at Stanford since my freshman year. For three years, I tutored for the Center for Teaching and Learning in
    courses including CS106A/B, CS103, CS107, CS109, CS111, and CS161. Since 2023, I've been serving as a Teaching Assistant for CS107, and this will 
    be my seventh time TA'ing this class.
